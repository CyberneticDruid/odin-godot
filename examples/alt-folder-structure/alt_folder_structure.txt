works for me on Windows/Linux with the imports: ("godot:gdext", "godot:godot", "godot:libgd")

//repo for Odin library
root/
  build/	// .lib/.so to my_lib_tests, or .dll/.so/etc. to extension project
  src/
    odin-godot/
    my_lib/
    my_lib_tests/
  build.sh //defines odin-godot as a collection named godot
